For guidance on the overall deprecations, removals and breaking changes workflow, please visit [Breaking changes, deprecations, and removing features](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/gitlab-the-product/#breaking-changes-deprecations-and-removing-features)

<!-- Use this template as a starting point for deprecations. -->

### Deprecation Summary

<!--
This should contain a brief description of the feature or functionality that is deprecated. The description should clearly state the potential impact of the deprecation to end users.

It is recommended that you link to the documentation.

The description of the deprecation should state what actions the user should take to rectify the behavior. If the deprecation is scheduled for an upcoming release, the content should remain in the deprecations documentation page until it has been completed. For example, if a deprecation is announced in 14.9 and scheduled to be completed in 15.0, the same content would be included in the documentation for 14.9, 14.10, and 15.0.

**If this issue proposes a breaking change outside a major release XX.0, you need to get approval from your manager and request collaboration from Product Operations on communication. Be sure to follow the guidance [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/gitlab-the-product/#breaking-changes-deprecations-and-removing-features.)**
