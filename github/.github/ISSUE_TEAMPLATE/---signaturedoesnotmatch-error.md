If you have encountered an error message like the following, you're in the right place! If not, please file a standard bug report (https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/new/choose).

where `<ApiCall>` changes depending on what command you ran.

## Do this first!

If you have encountered this error, please do the following FIRST (change the [] boxes to [x]):

- [ ] Read the user guide troubleshooting chapter (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-troubleshooting.html) to check for known issues like clock skew.
- [ ] Confirm that the error occurs even if you use one of the supported installation methods (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html).

If possible, try using the credentials with another non-Python SDK, like Javascript (http://aws.amazon.com/javascript).
