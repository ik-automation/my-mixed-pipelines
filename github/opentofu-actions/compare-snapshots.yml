# https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/.github/workflows/compare-snapshots.yml
# This workflow runs on pull requests to ensure that the snapshots produced by
# the equivalence tests are consistent with the snapshots that are checked in.
#
# If there is an inconsistency, it is the responsibility of the committer to
# review it, ensure that any changes are intentional, and then commit the new
# snapshots.
