# https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-Dockerfile
# This Dockerfile is not intended for general use, but is rather used to
# produce our "light" release packages as part of our official release
# pipeline.
#
# If you want to test this locally you'll need to set the three arguments
# to values realistic for what the hashicorp/actions-docker-build GitHub
# action would set, and ensure that there's a suitable "tofu" executable
# in the dist/linux/${TARGETARCH} directory.

FROM docker.io/alpine:latest AS default

# This is intended to be run from the hashicorp/actions-docker-build GitHub
# action, which sets these appropriately based on context.
ARG PRODUCT_VERSION=UNSPECIFIED
ARG PRODUCT_REVISION=UNSPECIFIED
ARG BIN_NAME=tofu

# This argument is set by the Docker toolchain itself, to the name
# of the CPU architecture we're building an image for.
# Our caller should've extracted the corresponding "tofu" executable
# into dist/linux/${TARGETARCH} for us to use.
ARG TARGETARCH

LABEL maintainer="OpenTofu Team"

# New standard version label.
LABEL version=$PRODUCT_VERSION

# Historical OpenTofu-specific label preserved for backward compatibility.
LABEL "com.tofu.version"="${PRODUCT_VERSION}"

RUN apk add --no-cache git openssh

# The hashicorp/actions-docker-build GitHub Action extracts the appropriate
# release package for our target architecture into the current working
# directory before running "docker build", which we'll then copy into the
# Docker image to make sure that we use an identical binary as all of the
# other official release channels.
COPY ["dist/linux/${TARGETARCH}/tofu", "/bin/tofu"]
