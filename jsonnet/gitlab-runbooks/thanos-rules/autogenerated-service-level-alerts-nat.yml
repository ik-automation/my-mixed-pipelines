      title: The received_tcp_packets SLI of the nat service (`{{ $labels.stage }}`
        stage) has not received any traffic in the past 30m
      description: |
        Monitors GCP Cloud NAT TCP packets received. Request rate is measures in IP packets, received by the Cloud NAT. Errors are dropped packets.

        High error rates could lead to network issues, including application errors, container fetch failures, etc.

        This alert signifies that the SLI is reporting a cessation of traffic; the signal is present, but is zero.

        High error rates could lead to network issues, including application errors, container fetch failures, etc.

        This alert signifies that the SLI was previously reporting traffic, but is no longer - the signal is absent.

        This could be caused by a change to the metrics used in the SLI, or by the service not receiving traffic.
