      description: |
        All transactions destined for the Postgres primary instance are routed through the pgbouncer service. This SLI models those transactions in aggregate.

        Error rate uses mtail metrics from pgbouncer logs.

        This alert signifies that the SLI is reporting a cessation of traffic; the signal is present, but is zero.

      description: |
        All transactions destined for the Postgres primary instance are routed through the pgbouncer service. This SLI models those transactions in aggregate.

        Error rate uses mtail metrics from pgbouncer logs.

        This alert signifies that the SLI was previously reporting traffic, but is no longer - the signal is absent.

        This could be caused by a change to the metrics used in the SLI, or by the service not receiving traffic.
